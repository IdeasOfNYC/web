(3)  Library:  Many areas don't have a lot of reading / library spaces to get books, to learn, study, or have a quiet space to read in.  Having libraries in schools and in our community bring kids and adults to have the benefits listed above.  (4) Food - A lot of the food in school is disgusting and many kids don't like the schedule of healthy fridays.  A solution is putting greens on the side of the trays unlike putting them in the foods.  Ex:  Greens in Burgers.  Doesn't look or taste good.  (5) Water -- the water is very dirty and many children don't have water to drink because of this.  Put filters in water fountains so when they drink it's clean.",

Half paid on persons choice card (unclear if that's what this says) and city / organizations pays the other half -- prioritizing support for yellow cabs. \n\nFacilitator note: one things this doesn't mention is that seniors find Access-a-ride very unreliable and need to still use car service as back-up option and need to pay full price. By having a program where we support people with disabilities and older adults get to their health appointments and to get around the city (such as grocery shopping), this would make a sizable impact on many people throughout the borough. I have personally seen this concept to be very successful in other parts of the country (ex: in South Bend, Indiana, the City helped a nonprofit organization to partner with Lyft to provide rides to work for high-risk individuals prone to being laid off for being late to work. this idea has won many awards in the \"civic innovation\" space).

    "challenge": "The US economy has increased greatly overall since the Great Depression (specifically until the late 1930s / early 1940s) but the economy could be given a boost.  According to research, in 2023, 11.1% of the U.S. population \"were in poverty.\"  It is then elaborated that poverty is determined by \"income.\"  Because of low income, poverty is likely.  Then, unhoused people doesn't seem to be right.  According to U.S. history, Black people thought that \"free people\" had houses provided by the Government.  If people are unhoused not many people might not consider coming to the U.S., if this issue isn't properly addressed.  The US is consdered a place for a new start / freedom.",
    "solution": "In order to solve these issues, here are some ideas:  -- Raise enough funds (from donation, doesn't need to be forced) and donate them to the unhoused, in order to help the unhoused fund for their house taxes.  Another option is to make a shelter for all unhoused people.  -- According to studies, majority of the economical average is based / determined on GDP (Gross Domestic Production) which can be based on the average home.  With some calculations, perhaps a boost / increase in income on people's payment can occur.",
